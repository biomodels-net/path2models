  * First reference SBML of all maps available:
    * metabolic models in SBML L3 core, corrected, without kinetics
    * non-metabolic models in SBML L3 qual augmented by Biocarta
    * metabolic models in SBML L3 core+qual (Clemens?)
The layout coordinates come from KEGG.

  * Mini-papers added to the Google documents

  * metabolic models in SBML L3 core, corrected, with kinetics
  * metabolic models in SBML L3 core, layout improved by Falk (same file than above?)
  * non-metabolic models in SBML L3 qual, layout by Michael
  * whole genome reconstruction, augmented by MetaCyc available

  * First complete version of the paper.
  * Models available through BioModels Database, at least as archives.
