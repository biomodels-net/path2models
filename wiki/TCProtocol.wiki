Version number of extensions and namespace
	- We will have a look at the libSBML SBasePlugin and implement similar methods	
	- We will provide convinient constructors that adds extensions directly to an instance of SBase	

Exceptions
	- There will be a static method "setStrict(boolean)" in the class JSBML

Layout extensions
	- Nico will improve the parser that was implemented by Sebastian Fr√∂hlich in order to support BoundingBoxes for an easier model layout interchange between KEGGtranslator and SBML2SBGN.
