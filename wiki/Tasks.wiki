1) Generation of SBML from KEGG metabolism + MetaCyc

2) Production of the qual specification
 - Martijn

3) Implementation of qual in JSBM

4) Generation of SBML from KEGG signalling => Depends on 2) and maybe 3)

5) (Implementation of SBGN AF in libSBGN) LibSBGN Milestone 2
 - Martijn 

6) Implementation of annotations in libSBGN
 - Martijn

7) Generation of kinetics models for metabolism  => Depends on 1)

8) Generation of logical models for signalling => Depends on 4)

9) Generation of enriched SBGN PD maps for metabolism => Depends on 7)

10) Generation of enriched SBGN AF maps for signalling => Depends on 8)
