1) Generation of SBML from KEGG metabolism + MetaCyc

Task leaders: Neil, Andreas, Clemens

 - NicoR (help integrating the final converter with all features in SBFC ?) 
 - Michael (if Nico needs any help)

Notes: Need to check the licence of MetaCyc. We may have to use only a subset.

2) Production of the qual specification

Task leaders: Claudine, Martijn

3) Implementation of qual in JSBML

Task leaders: NicoR, Andreas

4) (Implementation of SBGN AF in libSBGN) LibSBGN Milestone 2

Task leader: Martijn

5) Implementation of annotations in libSBGN

Task leader: Martijn

6) Generation of SBML from KEGG signalling => Depends on 2) and maybe 3)

Task leader: Andreas

 - Michael (could help with parts of 2 and 3 as well)

7) Generation of kinetics models for metabolism  => Depends on 1)

Task leaders: Neil, Andreas

Notes: two types of models, stoichiometric from Neil and modular rate laws from Andreas.

8) Generation of logical models for signalling => Depends on 4)

Task leader: Julio

9) Generation of enriched SBGN PD maps for metabolism => Depends on 7)

10) Generation of enriched SBGN AF maps for signalling => Depends on 8)
