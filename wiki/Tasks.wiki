1) Generation of SBML from KEGG metabolism + MetaCyc
Team leaders: Neil, Andreas, Clemens

 - NicoR (help integrating the final converter with all features in SBFC ?) 
 - Michael (if Nico needs any help)

2) Production of the qual specification
Team leaders: Claudine, Martijn

3) Implementation of qual in JSBML
Team leaders: NicoR, Andreas

4) Generation of SBML from KEGG signalling => Depends on 2) and maybe 3)
 - Michael (could help with parts of 2 and 3 as well)

5) (Implementation of SBGN AF in libSBGN) LibSBGN Milestone 2
Team leaders: Martijn

6) Implementation of annotations in libSBGN
Team leaders: Martijn

7) Generation of kinetics models for metabolism  => Depends on 1)

8) Generation of logical models for signalling => Depends on 4)

9) Generation of enriched SBGN PD maps for metabolism => Depends on 7)

10) Generation of enriched SBGN AF maps for signalling => Depends on 8)
