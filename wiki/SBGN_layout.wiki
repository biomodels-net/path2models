#summary SBGN layout algorithms and implementation

= Overview =

General-purpose Java libraries were tested for layout of simple biochemical networks that were already encoded in the SBGN AF test files. From the layouts, JGraph's hierarchical is the most promising but does not take into account compartments and may not suffice. Documentation of JGraph and JUNG is lacking important parts.

Review of scientific layout algorithms almost complete, original authors were in part able to provide their original implementations. Testing with these yields better results that will be used for the first conversion of SBML-qual to SBGN AF.

= Metabolic Part =

Code available

  * Gael's pipeline already available, SBML2SBGN will be used as-is
  * Currently using layout with GraphViz, which may not be optimal

Work subjects

  * Probably exchange layout algorithm with one found for signalling (cf. below)
  * Will concentrate on the signalling part for now

= Signalling Part = 

== General purpose Java libraries ==

  * *JGraph* (Commercial software with open-source licensing)
    * Data structes for graph handling
    * Visulization with SWING
    * Hierarchical layout included (for signalling)
    * does not support compartments
    * _implementation with simple SBGN networks available_

  * <s>*JUNG* (Java Universal Network/Graph Framework)</s>
    * Data structes for graph handling in 3rd party dependencies
    * Visulization with SWING
    * Only very basic layouts implemented, hierarchical fails when circles occur (Java Exception)

  * <s>*GraphViz*</s>
    * discouraged by Martijn because of non-Java solution

== Scientific implementations for biochemical networks ==

    * Hierarchical similar to Sugiyama
    * Uses largest circle as backbone, works well when there is a very limited number of connections to that circle
    * does not support compartments

== Implementation ==

  * Layout
    * Currently favoured: JGraph framework with ChiLay algorithms, on the path2models SVN for testing.
    * Implementation for subset of glyphs available
    * Continued work will use these for the conversions and may be switched at a later point in time if layout improvements can be observed.

  * SBML qual input
    * JSBML+extension set up and simple tests work
    * TODO: construct SBGN object from SBML-qual (this week)
