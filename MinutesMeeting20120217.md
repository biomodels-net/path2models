# Minutes of the path2models meeting 2012 02 17 #

attendees : Falk, Michael, Andreas, Clemens, Finja, Nico, Neil

status of the metabolics models : found and fix the error found by Neil. Will generate again few models so that Neil can check the generated models. Neil was surprised by the grouping of metabolite. He will ungroup them for his models, they can be left as they are for the signaling models.
Clemens will provide the yeast models to Neil.

status of layout/SBGN by Michael : using a hierarchical layout that work reasonably well now for qual models. Michael should provide the generated SBGN for singaling models next week

The aglorithm from Falk is working inside vanted and they plan to make it availble as a library but he does not know when that will be availble. He will know a bit more next week and should be able to give an approximate date beginning of march.

Vanted could be used now to generate the SBGN using a script. We will send a few models to Falk so that they can try if Vanted could be use easily.
They will try to generate sbml + sbgnml file with few added informations.

Biocarta information is parsed and now Finja is doing comparison with the kegg models to find what is missing. The models with biocarta informtation should be done for next week.
